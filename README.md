  I build and maintain real-world IT setups: routing, VLANs, firewalls, virtualization, and self-hosted services.
  <br/>
  Focus: reliable infrastructure, clean network design, and automation where it actually matters.

## What I work on
- **Networking**: VLAN design, segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, OSPF, router-on-a-stick, access policies
- **Virtualization**: Proxmox, VM/LXC layout, resource planning, backup strategies
- **Self-hosting**: media/services, reverse proxy, DNS, monitoring, secure remote access
- **Ops mindset**: documentation, repeatable configs, change control, and “don’t break prod”

## Featured Projects
### 🚧 Life-Z (DayZ Server)
- Hardcore survival community project (private ops repo)
- Modpack/config maintenance, server structure, testing environment, tooling

> If you want, I can also format this section as “buttons” and add a small project card layout.

## Homelab Stack (typical)
- **Hypervisor**: Proxmox
- **Networking**: VLANs, L3 switching, firewall boundary, segmented zones (DMZ/Home/Management)
- **Services**: DNS filtering, dashboards, game servers, media services
- **Security**: least privilege, tight east-west rules, no secrets in Git

## Tooling I’m comfortable with
- **Networking**: Cisco-style switching/routing concepts, VLANs, trunking, ACLs, OSPF
- **Systems**: Windows + Linux basics, services, storage, troubleshooting
- **Infra**: Proxmox, Docker basics, monitoring/logging fundamentals
- **Scripting**: basic automation (expanding)

## Notes
- I don’t publish secrets. If it looks like a secret, it doesn’t belong in Git.
- I prefer practical documentation over perfect documentation.
